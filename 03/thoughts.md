# Part 1
* another parsing problem
* my regex skills are getting a workout
* took forever to track down that I missed one of the symbols in my regex (/, which was not in the sample)
# Part 2
* woof, I had to refactor and rethink my logic quite a bit to get from 1 to 2 on this one
* I am challenging myself to do at least some code cleanup as I go through, which is helping
* * I ended up making certain methods more generic to at least attempt DRY, which ended up helping
* the solution to my main problem was to stop thinking procedurally, and start thinking OOP-style
* * specifically, adding an 'is_adjacent' method to my GridItem class simplified all my logic
* this took me almost 3 hours (with some breaks), but it shouldn't have - most of that was either my own self-imposed rules, or carelessness - regardless, when I finished, I got a great endorphin/seratonin/dopamine rush/boost.
