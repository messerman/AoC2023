# Part 1
* Decided just to math this one, instead of any clever coding - always fun to dust off the ol' quadratic equation.
* Unfortunately I read the result of one of the samples wrong - (30,200) as 11 and not 9 (11 was the minimum number, not the result), and as such I spent several hours trying to figure out what I'd done wrong, before realizing the next morning that I was right
* didn't even bother writing a parser - just plugged in the numbers directly
# Part 2
* able to 100% re-use my solution (still without a parser) from part 1, and just plugged the numbers in directly, in the interpreter - instant solve
* still going to write the parser when I have a chance ... aaaaand done
