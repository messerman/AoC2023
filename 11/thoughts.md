# Part 1
* seemed daunting at first (because of the shortest-path scenario), but this turned out easy
* I did the expansion w/ math on the overall universe size and each individual galaxy location, rather than having an actual grid
# Part 2
* added visualizations
* pretty simple, since I did the math-y way in part 1, but I had an off-by-one error ("double in size" not "increase by 1") and a "used addition when should have used multiplication" error (I did "increase by 10" instead of "multiply by 10")
